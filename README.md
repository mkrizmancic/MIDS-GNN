## Replicating the paper results

### Table I

We ran the hyperparameter optimization on Weights & Biases (wandb).

There were initially 2 sweeps:
1. using the single label approach (wandb sweep `HPC_labels_single`)
2. using the multi-label approach (wandb sweep `HPC_labels_all`)

These sweeps used only the decision GNN (5 layers) when no probability feature was used. For fair comparison, we ran 2 additional sweeps testing the end-to-end model (10 layers) with a bottleneck in the middle to mimic the behavior of the initial model consisting of a probability GNN and a decision GNN:
1. using the single label approach (wandb sweep `HPC_end_to_end_single_squeezed`)
2. using the multi-label approach (wandb sweep `HPC_end_to_end_squeezed`)

Using the `analyze_accuracies.ipynb` notebook, download each run and store the results in a csv file. The notebook will download runs from all mentioned sweeps.
- `labels_all_best.csv` - multi-label, best runs for each architecture based on validation loss
- `labels_all_full.csv` - multi-label, all runs for each architecture
- `labels_single_best.csv` - single label, best runs for each architecture based on validation loss
- `labels_single_full.csv` - single label, all runs for each architecture
- `combined_best.csv` - combined `labels_all_best.csv` and `labels_single_best.csv` for comparison
These csv files are available in the `Results/` directory, so you can skip the download step.

The notebook will output a table for None (uniform), None (mixed), Noisy, Predicted, and True features.

Finally, the notebook downloads all the best models.

### Fig. 3
The results for Fig. 3 are generated by the `analyze_runtimes.ipynb` notebook.

We use only the multi-label, predicted probability approach.

Running the `analyze_accuracies.ipynb` notebook will download the best probability model and best decision models for each GNN architecture.

To avoid repeatedly making data on the fly, we set up the following pipeline:
1. pass every example from probability dataset through the probability model
1. record probability model execution time, but ignore the output
1. pass the same example (same graph) from the decision dataset through the decision model (input features are the same in both datasets, but the decision dataset additionally has the probability feature which is the same as the output from the probability model)
1. record decision model execution time and store the prediction
1. the total execution time is the sum of the probability model execution time and the decision model execution time

### Table II
The `analyze_runtimes.ipynb` notebook generates the results for Table II using the same approach as described above.

## Detailed results (not included in the paper)
Input the best model W&B run ID and run `analyze_detailed.ipynb`.
